<h1>TCP/IP security</h1>

<h2>Threat model for network security</h2>

<ul>
<li>Adversary can intercept / modify network traffic.</li>
<li>Adversary can send packets.</li>
<li>Adversary has full control of their own machines.</li>
<li>Adversary can participate in protocols (usually).
<ul>
<li>Often not feasible to keep bad guys out of a large systems.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Eavesdropping on packets.</p>

<ul>
<li>Important to keep in mind, but relatively well understood.</li>
<li>Any data sent over the network can be observed by an adversary.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sending / spoofing packets.</p>

<ul>
<li>IP allows sender to construct an arbitrary packet.</li>
<li>In particular, sender can fill in any source address.</li>
<li>Can pretend that a packet is coming from any address.</li>
<li>What can an adversary do with this?</li>
</ul>

<h2>A Look Back at "Security Problems in the TCP/IP Protocol Suite"</h2>

<p><a href="http://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2014/readings/lookback-tcpip.pdf">Paper here</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Easy target: trigger bugs in some implementation.</li>
<li>Author isn't so interested in this class of problems.</li>
<li>Instead, want to look at <strong>"protocol-level problems"</strong>.</li>
<li>What is a protocol-level problem?
<ul>
<li>A problem inherent in the design.</li>
<li>A correct implementation will have this problem.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Why is it so important?
<ul>
<li>Can fix implementation bugs.</li>
<li>To fix protocol-level bugs, might need to change protocol!
<ul>
<li>Might be incompatible with existing systems.</li>
<li>(As we will see, sometimes possible to come up with compatible fixes.)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>TCP sequence number attack</h2>

<ul>
<li>Standard handshake (figure on the right side of page 2):
<ul>
<li><code>C: SRC=C, DST=S, SYN(SNc)</code></li>
<li><code>S: SRC=S, DST=C, SYN(SNs), ACK(SNc)</code></li>
<li><code>C: SRC=C, DST=S, ACK(SNs)</code></li>
<li><code>C: SRC=C, DST=S, data(SNc), ACK(SNs)</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>How does the adversary know the data is coming from the client?
<ul>
<li>Only the client should have been able to receive the second message.</li>
<li>Thus, <strong>only the client should know SNs</strong>.</li>
<li>Third message is rejected, unless it has the right SNs value.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Suppose adversary A wants to simulate a connection to S from C.
(Assume A knows C's IP address -- usually not a big deal in practice.)
<ul>
<li><code>A: SRC=C, DST=S, SYN(SNc)</code></li>
<li><code>S: SRC=S, DST=C, SYN(SNs), ACK(SNc)</code> -- but this goes to C, not A</li>
<li><code>A: SRC=C, DST=S, ACK(SNs)</code>   -- but how to guess SNs?</li>
<li><code>A: SRC=C, DST=S, data(SNc)</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Where does the adversary get SNs?
<ul>
<li>TCP specification suggested a specific way to choose them.</li>
<li>In particular, increment at a ~constant rate: ~250,000 per second.</li>
<li>Why so specific?
<ul>
<li>Subtle interactions with reused connections (src/dst port numbers).</li>
<li>Want to avoid old packets (from past conns) interfering with new conn.</li>
<li>Ref: RFC 1185 appendix</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If adversary knows a recent sequence number, can guess the next one.
<ul>
<li>Implemention would actually bump ISN every second, making it easy to guess.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>What happens to the real packet that S sends to C (second pkt)?
<ul>
<li>C would assume the packet is from an old conn, send <code>RST</code> in response.</li>
<li>Even if that <code>RST</code> was sent, adversary could try to race before <code>RST</code> arrives.</li>
<li>Luckily, there was another curious bug; will get to it later.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>But why do sequence number attacks turn into a security problem?</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Spoof connections to applications that rely on IP addresses</h3>

<ul>
<li>E.g., Berkeley remote access tools: rlogin, rsh, rcp.</li>
<li>Allowed login without a password, if connection came from a "trusted" system.
<ul>
<li>Required connection to come from a trusted source port (512-1023).
<ul>
<li>Why this requirement?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Trusted rlogin/rsh/rcp program sent the client's username.</li>
<li>If username was the same as the account on the server, no password needed.</li>
<li>E.g.: "rsh athena.dialup.mit.edu ls".</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Made a bad assumption about what the TCP layer provided.
<ul>
<li><em>Assumed TCP conn from an IP address meant it really came from that host.</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>If adversary can guess SNs, then can simulate connection from trusted host.
<ul>
<li>Issue any command using rsh.</li>
<li>Could change the user's .rhosts file to allow login from attacker's host.</li>
<li>Then connect directly without having to simulate a connection.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Host-based authentication seems like a bad plan.
<ul>
<li>Especially relying on "trusted" vs "untrusted" ports on a machine.</li>
<li>Still in some use today: e.g., SMTP for outgoing mail.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Actually rlogin authentication was even worse: they authenticated by hostname.
<ul>
<li>Where does hostname come from?  Reverse DNS lookup.</li>
<li>E.g., 18.26.4.9: find the PTR record of 9.4.26.18.in-addr.arpa.</li>
<li>Owner of that domain can set PTR record to any hostname!
<ul>
<li>(Can make a slight improvement: check if host resolves to same addr.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Similar problems show up in log files: log resolved (untrusted) hostname.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Denial of service attack: connection reset</h3>

<ul>
<li>Once we know SNc, can send a RST packet.</li>
<li>Worse yet: server will accept a RST packet for any SNc value within window.</li>
<li>With a large window (~32K=2^15), only need 2^32/2^15 = 2^17 guesses.</li>
</ul>

<p>How bad is a connection reset?</p>

<ul>
<li>One target of such attacks were the TCP connections between BGP routers.</li>
<li>Causes routers to assume link failure, could affect traffic for minutes.</li>
<li>Solutions:
<ul>
<li>TTL hack (255): make sure BGP nodes only talk to direct neighbors by setting
<code>TTL = 1</code> in the TCP packets</li>
<li>MD5 header authentication (very specialized for router-to-router links).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Hijack existing connections</h3>

<ul>
<li>In similar vein, can also inject data into an existing connection.</li>
<li>All adversary needs to know is the current SNc.</li>
</ul>

<p>How to mitigate this problem?</p>

<ul>
<li>Baseline: don't rely on IP addresses for authentication.
<ul>
<li>Use encryption / authentication at a higher level.</li>
<li>Next lecture: Kerberos.</li>
<li>But still, want to fix the situation we're in, for TCP.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>ISPs can filter packets sent by their customers.
<ul>
<li>Often done today for small customers, but not consistently.</li>
<li>Not straightforward for customers with complex networks, multihoming, ..</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>How to patch up TCP?</p>

<ul>
<li>Can't choose ISN's in a completely random way, without violating TCP spec.
<ul>
<li>Might break connection (port) reuse guarantees.</li>
<li>ISN is 32 bits, means after ~2^16 = 65,000 connections you could get a
collision and reuse an ISN that matches an old connection.
<ul>
<li>old packets from that connection can be interpreted as being part of the
new connection</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Thus, it might be better if the ISNs <em>progress</em> incrementally with
wrap-around, so as to make collisions much less probable.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Random increments?
<ul>
<li>Should preserve increment rate (~250k/second).</li>
<li>Not a huge amount of randomness (say, low 8 bits per increment).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Aside: must be careful about how we generate random numbers!
<ul>
<li>Common PRNG: linear congruential generator: <code>R_k = A*R_{k-1}+B mod N</code>.</li>
<li>Not secure: given one pseudo-random value, can guess the next one!</li>
<li>Lots of better cryptographically secure PRNGs are available.
<ul>
<li>Ideally, use your kernel's built-in PRNG (/dev/random, /dev/urandom)</li>
<li>Ref: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortuna_(PRNG), or any stream cipher
like http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC4</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>However, SN values for different src/dst pairs never interact!</li>
<li>So, can choose the ISN using a random offset for each src/dst pair.
<ul>
<li>Nice trick: <code>ISN = ISN_oldstyle + F(srcip, srcport, dstip, dstport, secret)</code></li>
<li><code>F</code> is some pseudo-random function; roughly, think SHA1.</li>
<li>Requires no extra state to keep track of per-connection ISNs.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Are sequence number attacks still relevant?</p>

<ul>
<li>Most operating systems implement the per-connection ISN workaround above.
<ul>
<li>Ref: Linux <code>secure_tcp_sequence_number</code> in <code>net/core/secure_seq.c</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>But other protocols suffer from almost identical problems -- e.g., DNS.
<ul>
<li>DNS runs over UDP, no seq numbers, just ports, and dst port fixed (53).</li>
<li>If adversary knows client is making a query, can fake a response.
<ul>
<li>Just need to guess src port, often predictable.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Problem gained popularity in 2008, though well-understood by djb before.
<ul>
<li>Ref: http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/forgery.html</li>
<li>Ref: http://unixwiz.net/techtips/iguide-kaminsky-dns-vuln.html</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Solution: carefully take advantage of all possible randomness!
<ul>
<li>DNS queries contain 16-bit query ID, and can randomize ~16 bit src port.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Solution: deploy DNSSEC (signed DNS records, including missing records).
<ul>
<li>One problem: key distribution (who is allowed to sign each domain?)</li>
<li>Another problem: name enumeration (to sign "no such name" responses).</li>
<li>Partially mitigated by NSEC3: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5155</li>
<li>Slow adoption, not much incentive to upgrade, non-trivial costs.</li>
<li>Costs include both performance and administrative (key/cert management).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>SYN flooding</h2>

<ul>
<li>Note that server must store some state when it receives a SYN packet.
<ul>
<li>It needs to store the <code>SN_s</code> sequence number it sent to that client</li>
<li>Called a half-open connection: replied with SYN-ACK, waiting for the ACK.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What if it receives SYN messages from many sources?
<ul>
<li>Many implementations try to keep state for all half-open connections.</li>
<li>But eventually run out of memory, must reject connections!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Annoying problem: we don't even know who we're keeping state for!
<ul>
<li>Adversary could have a single host, and generate SYNs from many src IPs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Denial-of-service attack: big asymmetry between client + server resources.
<ul>
<li>Client spoofs a single packet (less than 1 millisecond).</li>
<li>Server wastes memory until connection times out (minutes).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Defense for SYN flooding: SYN cookies.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Idea:</strong> make the server stateless, until it receives that third packet (ACK).</li>
<li>Why is this tricky?
<ul>
<li>Need to ensure an adversary can't make up a conn from any src address.</li>
<li>Previously, this was done by storing ISNs, and expecting it in the ACK.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use a bit of cryptography to achieve similar goal.</li>
<li>Encode server-side state into sequence number.
<ul>
<li>ISNs = <code>MAC_k(src/dst addr+port, timestamp) || timestamp</code></li>
<li>Timestamp is coarse-grained (e.g., minutes).</li>
<li>Server stores secret key <code>k</code>, not shared with anyone else.
<ul>
<li>Detailed ref: http://cr.yp.to/syncookies.html</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Server computes seq as above when sending SYN-ACK response.</li>
<li>Server can verify state is intact by verifying hash (MAC) on ACK's seq.
<ul>
<li>Not quite ideal: need to think about replay attacks within timestamp.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Another problem: if third packet lost, noone retransmits.
<ul>
<li>Only a problem for protocols where server speaks first.</li>
<li>Because server does <strong>NOT</strong> keep the connection state anymore, so it does
not know there's a <em>hanging connection</em>, so it will never retransmit its
SYN message to the client after waiting too long for the client's ACK.</li>
<li>Similarly, the client will not know its ACK packet got lost (it's never ACK'd
back, and since the client is waiting on the server to send 
the first message (assumption), the client will not send any other data either.</li>
<li>Maybe not a big deal in case of a DoS attack.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Another DoS attack vector: bandwidth amplification.</p>

<ul>
<li>Send ICMP echo request (ping) packets to the broadcast address of a network.
<ul>
<li>E.g., 18.26.7.255.</li>
<li>Used to be that you'd get an ICMP echo reply from all machines on network.</li>
<li>What if you fake a packet from victim's address?  Victim gets all replies.</li>
<li>Find a subnet with 100 machines on a fast network: 100x amplification!
<ul>
<li>Ref: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smurf_attack</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Can we fix this?
<ul>
<li>Routers now block "directed broadcast" (packets sent to broadcast address).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Modern-day variant: DNS amplification.
<ul>
<li>DNS is also a request-response service.</li>
<li>With a small query, server might send back a large response.</li>
<li>With DNSSEC, responses contain lots of signatures, so they're even larger!</li>
<li>Since DNS runs over UDP, source address is completely unverified.
<ul>
<li>Ref: http://blog.cloudflare.com/deep-inside-a-dns-amplification-ddos-attack</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Can we fix the DNS attack?
<ul>
<li>Actually quite hard! Root name servers must answer to queries from anyone.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What if we had a chance to re-design DNS from scratch?
<ul>
<li>One possible plan: query must be as big as response (require padding).</li>
<li>General technique: force client to expend at least as much work.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>TCP congestion control.</p>

<ul>
<li>Receiver can get the sender to speed up, by ACKing unreceived segments.</li>
<li>Or send more ACKs (e.g., send ACK for each byte instead of every packet).</li>
</ul>

<p>Routing protocols: overly-trusting of participants.</p>

<ul>
<li>ARP: within a single Ethernet network.
<ul>
<li>To send IP packet, need the Ethernet MAC address of router / next hop.</li>
<li>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP): broadcast a request for target's MAC.</li>
<li>Anyone can listen to broadcast, send a reply; no authentication.</li>
<li>Adversary can impersonate router, intercept packets, even on switched net.</li>
<li>Potential solution: make the switch in charge of ARP.
<ul>
<li>Not widely deployed: would require managing MAC/IP addresses carefully.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>DHCP: again, within a single Ethernet network.
<ul>
<li>Client asks for IP address by sending a broadcast request.</li>
<li>Server responds, no authentication (some specs exist but not widely used).
<ul>
<li>If you just plugged into a network, might not know what to expect.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Lots of fields: IP address, router address, DNS server, DNS domain list, ..</li>
<li>Adversary can impersonate DHCP server to new clients on the network.
<ul>
<li>Can choose their DNS servers, DNS domains, router, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Also, DoS attack on server: ask for lots of leases, from many MAC addrs.</li>
<li>Solution: make the switch in charge of DHCP (forward reqs to real server).
<ul>
<li>Not widely deployed: would require careful switch configuration.</li>
<li>Even more complicated on a wireless network.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>BGP: Internet-wide (similar to RIP attacks described in paper).
<ul>
<li>Any BGP participant router can announce route to a prefix.</li>
<li>What if adversary has a router? Can announce any prefix or route.</li>
<li>Is this problem still relevant?
<ul>
<li>Spammers often exploit this: announce an unused address, and send spam.</li>
<li>Gets around IP-level blacklisting of spam senders: choose almost any IP!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How to fix?
<ul>
<li>SBGP: cryptographic signing of route announcements.</li>
<li>Must know who is allowed to announce every particular IP prefix.</li>
<li>Requires someone to distribute keys / certificates for every IP prefix.</li>
<li>Bootstrapping problem is tricky; some performance overheads too.</li>
<li>Getting some traction but still not widely deployed.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Many other problems too.</p>

<ul>
<li>ICMP messages like redirect: no authentication, basically unused now.</li>
<li>Exposing too much information (netstat, SNMP, finger): mostly fixed.
identd ("Authentication Service"): bad design, no real authentication.</li>
<li>Email: real problem but no practical solutions yet.
<ul>
<li>Authentication vs authorization.</li>
<li>E.g., PGP would not solve the spam problem.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Passwords in protocols: supporting ONLY passwords isn't so great.
<ul>
<li>We'll talk about alternatives in a few weeks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>FTP data transfer protocol.
<ul>
<li>Server connects back to client to send a file to the client.</li>
<li>Client tells the server what IP address and port number to use.</li>
<li>Could be used for port-scanning from server's IP.</li>
<li>Could be used to send any traffic (embedded in file) from server's IP.
<ul>
<li>E.g., back to IP authentication problems: rlogin, spam, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>How do adversaries know what software / protocol you are running?</p>

<ul>
<li>Probing:
<ul>
<li>Check if a system is listening on a well-known port.</li>
<li>Protocols / systems often send an initial banner message.</li>
<li>nmap can guess OS by measuring various impl-specific details.
<ul>
<li>Ref: http://nmap.org/book/man-os-detection.html</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use DNS to look up the hostname for an IP address; may give hints.</li>
<li>Guessing: assume system is vulnerable, try to exploit bug.</li>
</ul>

<p>How do adversaries know the IP address of the system to attack?</p>

<ul>
<li>traceroute to find routers along the way, for BGP attacks.</li>
<li>Can also just scan the entire Internet: only 2^32 addresses.
<ul>
<li>1 Gbps (100 MB/s) network link, 64 byte minimum packets.</li>
<li>~1.5M packets per second.</li>
<li><code>2^32 = 4 Billion</code> packets in ~2500 seconds, or 45 minutes.</li>
<li><a href="https://zmap.io/">zmap</a>: implementation of this </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Why are things so insecure at the TCP/IP level?</p>

<ul>
<li>Historically, designers did not worry as much about security.
<ul>
<li>Even Bellovin says: "The Internet in 1989 was a much friendlier place".</li>
<li>Original Internet had a small number of relatively trustworthy users.</li>
<li>Design requirements changed over time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>End-to-end argument in action.
<ul>
<li>Must provide security at the application level anyway.</li>
<li>Things are "good enough" at the transport level to let application work.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Some fixes do get added, but only for the worst problems / easier solutions.</li>
</ul>

<p>How to improve security?</p>

<ul>
<li>Protocol-compatible fixes to TCP implementations.</li>
<li>Firewalls.
<ul>
<li>Partial fix, but widely used.</li>
<li>Issue: adversary may be within firewalled network.</li>
<li>Issue: hard to determine if packet is "malicious" or not.</li>
<li>Issue: even for fields that are present (src/dst), hard to authenticate.</li>
<li>TCP/IP's design not a good match for firewall-like filtering techniques.</li>
<li>E.g., IP packet fragmentation: TCP ports in one packet, payload in another.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Implement security on top of TCP/IP: SSL/TLS, Kerberos, SSH, etc.
<ul>
<li>Beware: this paper isn't clear on encryption vs. authentication.</li>
<li>Will talk about this more in next lecture on Kerberos.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use cryptography (encryption, signing, MACs, etc).
<ul>
<li>Quite a hard problem: protocol design, key distribution, trust, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Some kinds of security hard to provide on top: DoS-resistance, routing.</li>
<li>Deployment of replacement protocols: SBGP, DNSSEC.</li>
</ul>
