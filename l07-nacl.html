<h1>Native Client</h1>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> These lecture notes were slightly modified from the ones posted on the 6.858 <a href="http://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2014/schedule.html">course website</a> from 2014.</p>

<h3>What's the goal of this paper?</h3>

<ul>
<li>At the time, browsers allowed any web page to run only JS (+Flash) code.</li>
<li>Want to allow web apps to run native (e.g., x86) code on user's machine.
<ul>
<li>Don't want to run complex code on server.</li>
<li>Requires lots of server resources, incurs high latency for users.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Why is this useful?
<ul>
<li>Performance.</li>
<li>Languages other than JS.</li>
<li>Legacy apps.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Actually being used in the real world.
<ul>
<li>Ships as part of Google Chrome: the NaCl runtime is a browser extension.</li>
<li>Web page can run a NaCl program much like a Flash program.</li>
<li>Javascript can interact with the NaCl program by passing messages.</li>
<li>NaCl also provides strong sandboxing for some other use cases.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Core problem: sandboxing x86 code.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Using Native Client:</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>https://developers.google.com/native-client/</p>

<ul>
<li>Install browser plug in</li>
<li>Use Nacl tool change to compile C or C++ program</li>
<li>There are restrictions on what system calls you can use</li>
<li>Example app: games (don't need much systems support)</li>
<li>Special interface to talk to browser (in release called Pepper)</li>
<li>Make a web page that includes Nacl module:</li>
</ul>

<p><code>
&lt;embed name="nacl_module"
       id="hello_world"
       width=0 height=0
       src="hello_world.nmf"
       type="application/x-nacl" /&gt;
</code></p>

<ul>
<li>Module is "controled" x86 code.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Quick demo:</h3>

<pre><code>% urxvt -fn xft:Monospace-20
% export NACL_SDK_ROOT=/home/nickolai/tmp/nacl_sdk/pepper_35
% cd ~/6.858/git/fall14/web/lec/nacl-demo
## this is from NaCl's tutorial part1
% vi hello.cc
% vi index.html
% make
% make serve
## copy-paste and add --no-dir-check as the error message asks
## visit http://localhost:5103/
## change hello.cc to "memset(buf, 'A', 1024);"
% make
% !python
## visit http://localhost:5103/
## ctrl-shift-J, view console
</code></pre>

<h2>What are some options for safely running x86 code?</h2>

<p><strong>Approach 0:</strong> trust the code developer.</p>

<ul>
<li>ActiveX, browser plug-ins, Java, etc.</li>
<li>Developer signs code with private key.</li>
<li>Asks user to decide whether to trust code from some developer.</li>
<li>Users are bad at making such decisions (e.g., with ActiveX code).
<ul>
<li>Works for known developers (e.g., Windows Update code, signed by MS).</li>
<li>Unclear how to answer for unknown web applications (other than "no").</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Native Client's goal is to enforce safety, avoid asking the user.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Approach 1:</strong> hardware protection / OS sandboxing.</p>

<ul>
<li>Similar plan to some ideas we've already read: OKWS, Capsicum, VMs, ..</li>
<li>Run untrusted code as a regular user-space program or a separate VM.</li>
<li>Need to control what system calls the untrusted code can invoke.
<ul>
<li>Linux: seccomp.</li>
<li>FreeBSD: Capsicum.</li>
<li>MacOSX: Seatbelt.</li>
<li>Windows: unclear what options exist.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Native client uses these techniques, but only as a backup plan.</li>
<li>Why not rely on OS sandboxing directly?
<ul>
<li>Each OS may impose different, sometimes incompatible requirements.
<ul>
<li>System calls to allocate memory, create threads, etc.</li>
<li>Virtual memory layout (fixed-address shared libraries in Windows?).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>OS kernel vulnerabilities are reasonably common.
<ul>
<li>Allows untrusted code to escape sandbox.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Not every OS might have a sufficient sandboxing mechanism.
<ul>
<li>E.g., unclear what to do on Windows, without a special kernel module.</li>
<li>Some sandboxing mechanisms require root: don't want to run Chrome as root.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hardware might have vulnerabilities (!).
<ul>
<li>Authors claim some instructions happen to hang the hardware.</li>
<li>Would be unfortunate if visiting a web site could hang your computer.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Approach 2:</strong> software fault isolation (Native Client's primary sandboxing plan).</p>

<ul>
<li>Given an x86 binary to run in Native Client, verify that it's safe.
<ul>
<li>Verification involves checking each instruction in the binary.</li>
<li>Some instructions might be always safe: allow.</li>
<li>Some instructions might be sometimes safe.
<ul>
<li>Software fault isolation's approach is to require a check before these.</li>
<li>Must ensure the check is present at verification time.</li>
<li>Another option: insert the check through binary rewriting.</li>
<li>Hard to do with x86, but might be more doable with higher-level lang.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Some instructions might be not worth making safe: prohibit.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>After verifying, can safely run it in same process as other trusted code.</li>
<li>Allow the sandbox to call into trusted "service runtime" code.
<ul>
<li>Figure 2 from paper</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>What does safety mean for a Native Client module?</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Goal #1:</strong> does not execute any disallowed instructions (e.g., syscall, int).
<ul>
<li>Ensures module does not perform any system calls.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Goal #2:</strong> does not access memory or execute code outside of module boundary.
<ul>
<li>Ensures module does not corrupt service runtime data structures.</li>
<li>Ensures module does not jump into service runtime code, ala return-to-libc.</li>
<li>As described in paper, module code+data live within [0..256MB) virt addrs.
<ul>
<li>Need not populate entire 256MB of virtual address space.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Everything else should be protected from access by the NaCl module.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>How to check if the module can execute a disallowed instruction?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Strawman: scan the executable, look for "int" or "syscall" opcodes.
<ul>
<li>If check passes, can start running code.</li>
<li>Of course, need to also mark all code as read-only.</li>
<li>And all writable memory as non-executable.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Complication:</em> x86 has variable-length instructions.
<ul>
<li>"int" and "syscall" instructions are 2 bytes long.</li>
<li>Other instructions could be anywhere from 1 to 15 bytes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Suppose program's code contains the following bytes:
<ul>
<li><code>25 CD 80 00 00</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>If interpreted as an instruction starting from 25, it is a 5-byte instr:
<ul>
<li><code>AND %eax, $0x000080cd</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>But if interpreted starting from CD, it's a 2-byte instr:
<ul>
<li><code>INT $0x80   # Linux syscall</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Could try looking for disallowed instructions at every offset..
<ul>
<li>Likely will generate too many false alarms.</li>
<li>Real instructions may accidentally have some "disallowed" bytes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Reliable disassembly</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Plan:</strong> ensure code executes only instructions that verifier knows about.
<ul>
<li>How can we guarantee this? Table 1 and Figure 3 in paper.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Scan forward through all instructions, starting at the beginning.</li>
<li>If we see a jump instruction, make sure it's jumping to address we saw.</li>
<li>Easy to ensure for static jumps (constant addr).</li>
<li>Cannot ensure statically for <strong>computed jumps</strong> (jump to addr from register).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Computed jumps</h3>

<ul>
<li>Idea is to rely on runtime instrumentation: added checks before the jump.</li>
<li>For computed jump to %eax, NaCl requires the following code: <br />
<code>
AND $0xffffffe0, %eax       # Clear last 4 bits (=&gt; only jump to 32-byte boundary) <br />
JMP *%eax
</code></li>
<li>This will ensure jumps go to multiples of 32 bytes. Why 32-byte?
<ul>
<li>longer than the max. instruction length</li>
<li>power of 2</li>
<li>need to fit trampoline (see below later) code</li>
<li>not bigger because we don't want to waste space for single instruction 
jump targets</li>
</ul></li>
<li>NaCl also requires that no instructions span a 32-byte boundary.</li>
<li>Compiler's job is to ensure both of these rules.
<ul>
<li>Replace every computed jump with the two-instruction sequence above.</li>
<li>Add NOP instructions if some other instruction might span 32-byte boundary.</li>
<li>Add NOPs to pad to 32-byte multiple if next instr is a computed jump target.</li>
<li>Always possible because NOP instruction is just one byte.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Verifier's job is to check these rules.
<ul>
<li>During disassembly, make sure no instruction spans a 32-byte boundary.</li>
<li>For computed jumps, ensure it's in a two-instruction sequence as above.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What will this guarantee?
<ul>
<li>Verifier checked all instructions starting at 32-byte-multiple addresses.</li>
<li>Computed jumps can only go to 32-byte-multiple addresses.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What prevents the module from jumping past the AND, directly to the JMP?
<ul>
<li>Pseudo-instruction: the NaCl jump instruction will never be compiled so
that the <code>AND</code> part and the <code>JMP</code> part are <em>split</em> by a 32-byte boundary.
Thus, you could never jump straight to the <code>JMP</code> part.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How does NaCl deal with <code>RET</code> instructions?
<ul>
<li>Prohibited -- effectively a computed jump, with address stored on stack.
<ul>
<li>This is due to an <strong>inherent race condition</strong>: the <code>ret</code> instruction pops
the return address off the stack and then jumps to it. NaCl could check the
address on the stack before its popped, but there's TOCTOU problem here:
the address could be modified immediately after the check by another thread.
This can happen because the return address is in memory, not in a register.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Instead, compiler must generate explicit POP + computed jump code.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Why are the rules from Table 1 in the paper necessary?</h3>

<ul>
<li>C1: executable code in memory is not writable.</li>
<li>C2: binary is statically linked at zero, code starts at 64K.</li>
<li>C3: all computed jumps use the two-instruction sequence above.</li>
<li>C4: binary is padded to a page boundary with one or more HLT instruction.</li>
<li>C5: no instructions, or our special two-instruction pair, can span 32 bytes.</li>
<li>C6/C7: all jump targets reachable by fall-through disassembly from start.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Homework question:</strong> what happens if verifier gets some instruction length wrong?</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Depending on where you offset into a seamingly innocent x86 instruction
stream, you can get unexpectedly useful instructions out (In the BROP paper, we got
a "pop rsi; ret;" from offsetting at 0x7 into the BROP gadget).</p>

<p>If the checker incorrectly computes the length of an x86 instruction, then the
attacker can exploit this. Suppose the checker computes <code>bad_len(i)</code> as the
length of a certain instruction <code>i</code> at address <code>a</code>. The attacker, knowledgeable
about x86, could write assembly code at address <code>a + bad_len(i)</code> that passes all
the checks and seems harmless. This assembly code is what the NaCl checker
would "see", given the instruction length bug. However, when the code is
executed, the next instruction after instruction <code>i</code> would be at address 
<code>a + real_len(i)</code>. And, the attacker carefully crafted his code such that the 
instructions at and after <code>a + real_len(i)</code> do something useful. Like jumping
outside the sandbox, or a syscall.</p>

<h2>How to prevent NaCl module from jumping to 32-byte multiple outside its code?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Could use additional checks in the computed-jump sequence. <br />
<code>
AND $0x0fffffe0, %eax <br />
JMP *%eax
</code></li>
<li>Why don't they use this approach?
<ul>
<li>Longer instruction sequence for computed jumps.</li>
<li>Their sequence is <code>3+2=5</code> bytes, above sequence is <code>5+2=7</code> bytes.</li>
<li>An alternative solution is pretty easy: segmentation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Segmentation</h3>

<ul>
<li>x86 hardware provides "segments".</li>
<li>Each memory access is with respect to some "segment".
<ul>
<li>Segment specifies base + size.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Segments are specified by a segment selector: ptr into a segment table.
<ul>
<li><code>%cs, %ds, %ss, %es, %fs, %gs</code></li>
<li>Each instruction can specify what segment to use for accessing memory.</li>
<li>Code always fetched using the <code>%cs</code> segment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Address translation: (segment selector, addr) -> (segbase + addr % segsize).</li>
<li>Typically, all segments have <code>base=0, size=max</code>, so segmentation is a no-op.</li>
<li>Can change segments: in Linux, <code>modify_ldt()</code> system call.</li>
<li>Can change segment selectors: just <code>MOV %ds</code>, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Limiting code/data to module's size:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Add a new segment with <code>offset=0, size=256MB.</code></li>
<li>Set all segment selectors to that segment.</li>
<li>Modify verifier to reject any instructions that change segment selectors.</li>
<li>Ensures all code and data accesses will be within [0..256MB).</li>
<li>(NaCl actually seems to limit the code segment to the text section size.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>What would be required to run Native Client on a system without segmentation?</h3>

<ul>
<li>For example, AMD/Intel decided to drop segment limits in their 64-bit CPUs.
<ul>
<li>One practical possibility: run in 32-bit mode.</li>
<li>AMD/Intel CPUs still support segment limits in 32-bit mode.</li>
<li>Can run in 32-bit mode even on a 64-bit OS.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Would have to change the computed-jump code to limit target to 256MB.</li>
<li>Would have to add runtime instrumentation to each memory read/write.</li>
<li>See the paper in additional references below for more details.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why doesn't Native Client support exceptions for modules?</h3>

<ul>
<li>What if module triggers hardware exception: null ptr, divide-by-zero, etc.</li>
<li>OS kernel needs to deliver exception (as a signal) to process.</li>
<li>But Native Client runs with an unusual stack pointer/segment selector <code>%ss</code>.
<ul>
<li>So if the OS tried to deliver the exception, it would terminate the program</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Some OS kernels refuse to deliver signals in this situation.</li>
<li>NaCl's solution is to prohibit hardware exceptions altogether.</li>
<li>Language-level exceptions (e.g., C++) do not involve hardware: no problem.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What would happen if a NaCl module had a buffer overflow?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Any computed call (function pointer, return address) has to use 2-instr jump.</li>
<li>As a result, can only jump to validated code in the module's region.</li>
<li>Buffer overflows might allow attacker to take over module.</li>
<li>However, can't escape NaCl's sandbox.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Limitations of the original NaCl design?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Static code: no JIT, no shared libraries.</li>
<li>Dynamic code supported in recent versions (see additional refs at the end).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Invoking trusted code from sandbox</h2>

<ul>
<li>Short code sequences that transition to/from sandbox located in [4KB..64KB).</li>
<li><strong>Trampoline</strong> undoes the sandbox, enters trusted code.
<ul>
<li>Starts at a 32-byte multiple boundary.</li>
<li>Loads unlimited segment into <code>%cs, %ds</code> segment selectors.</li>
<li>Jumps to trusted code that lives above 256MB.</li>
<li><em>Slightly tricky:</em> must ensure trampoline fits in 32 bytes.
<ul>
<li>(Otherwise, module could jump into middle of trampoline code..)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Trusted code first switches to a different stack: why?
<ul>
<li>the NaCl module stack is incapable of receiving exceptions, and
the library code called by the trampoline could get exceptions</li>
<li>also, in the paper they mention this new stack, which is per-thread
will reside outside the untrusted address space, so as to protect
it from <strong>attacks by other NaCl module threads</strong>!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Subsequently, trusted code has to re-load other segment selectors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Springboard</strong> (re-)enters the sandbox on return or initial start.
<ul>
<li>Springboard slots (32-byte multiples) start with <code>HLT</code> (halt) instruction.
<ul>
<li>Prevents computed jumps into springboard by module code.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Re-set segment selectors, jump to a particular address in NaCl module.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>What's provided by the service runtime? (NaCl's "system call" equivalent)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Memory allocation: sbrk/mmap.</li>
<li>Thread operations: create, etc.</li>
<li>IPC: initially with Javascript code on page that started this NaCl program.</li>
<li>Browser interface via NPAPI: DOM access, open URLs, user input, ..</li>
<li>No networking: can use Javascript to access network according to SOP.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How secure is Native Client?</h2>

<ul>
<li>List of attack surfaces: start of section 2.3.</li>
<li>Inner sandbox: validator has to be correct (had some tricky bugs!).</li>
<li>Outer sandbox: OS-dependent plan.
<ul>
<li>On Linux, probably seccomp.</li>
<li>On FreeBSD (if NaCl supported it), Capsicum would make sense.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Why the outer sandbox?
<ul>
<li>Possible bugs in the inner sandbox.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What could an adversary do if they compromise the inner sandbox?
<ul>
<li>Exploit CPU bugs.</li>
<li>Exploit OS kernel bugs.</li>
<li>Exploit bugs in other processes communicating with the sandbox proc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Service runtime: initial loader, runtime trampoline interfaces.</li>
<li>Inter-module communication (IMC) interface + NPAPI: complex code, can (and did) have bugs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How well does it perform?</h3>

<ul>
<li>CPU overhead seems to be dominated by NaCl's code alignment requirements.
<ul>
<li>Larger instruction cache footprint.</li>
<li>But for some applications, NaCl's alignment works better than gcc's.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Minimal overhead for added checks on computed jumps.</li>
<li>Call-into-service-runtime performance seems comparable to Linux syscalls.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How hard is it to port code to NaCl?</h3>

<ul>
<li>For computational things, seems straightforward: 20 LoC change for H.264.</li>
<li>For code that interacts with system (syscalls, etc), need to change them.
<ul>
<li>E.g., Bullet physics simulator (section 4.4).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
