<pre><code>           USER AUTHENTICATION
</code></pre>

<p>Core challenge: How can human users prove their
identity to a program?
  -Is there any solution that totally dominates
   passwords?
  -At first glance, passwords seem wretched.
      *Low entropy --> easy for attackers to 
       guess them.
      *Back-up security questions for passwords
       are low entropy too.
      *A user often employs a single password
       for multiple sites.
  -As the paper for today's class states, "The
   continued domination of passwords over all
   other methods of end-user authentication is
   a major embarrassment to security researchers."
  -But . . . is there actually an authentication
   scheme which totally dominates passwords?
  -Plan for today's lecture:
      1) See how current password schemes work.
      2) Talk about desirable properties for an
         authentication scheme.
      3) See how other authentication schemes
         compare to passwords.</p>

<p>A password is a secret that is shared between
the user and a server.
   -Naive implementation: server has a table that
    maps usernames to plaintext passwords.
    Problem: If attacker compromises the server,
    can recover all user/password pairs.
   -Improved solution: Server stores this table:
       user<em>name --> hash(user</em>password)
    User client supplies cleartext password to
    server, the server hashes the cleartext and
    does a table lookup.
    Advantage: Hash functions are difficult to
    invert, so it's difficult for attacker to
    perform a brute force attack. However . . .
    Problem: Attacker doesn't have to launch
    an inefficient brute force search over all
    possible passwords---the set of strings that
    are actually used as passwords is quite small!
        *Skewed distribution: top 5000 password
         values cover 20% of users.
        *Yahoo password study: Rule-of-thumb
         passwords contain 10-20 bits of entropy.
        *Hash functions are optimized performance;
         this helps attackers!
             -Ex: A laptop can calcuate SHA1s over
              small blocks at ~2M SHA1 ops/sec.
              Even if password has 20 bits of
              entropy, can crack one account/sec.
   -Server can use a computationally expensive
    key-derivation function (e.g., PBKDF2 or
    BCrypt).
        *These functions have adjustable costs,
         so they can be arbitrarily slow.
        *Ex: can make hash cost be 1 second -- O(1M)
         times slower than SHA1.
        *Internally, often performs repeated
         hashing using a slow hash.
        *Problem: adversary can build "rainbow
         tables".
             -Table of password-to-hash mappings.
             -Expensive to compute, but allows the
              attacker to efficiently invert hashes
              afterwards.
             -To maximize cost/benefit trade-off,
              the attacker only need to build
              a rainbow table for dictionary of
              common passwords.
             -Roughly: 1-second expensive hash
                           |-> 1M seconds = 10 days
              to hash common pws. After that, can
              very quickly crack common passwords
              in any password db.
   -Better solution: server can use password salts.
        *Input some additional randomness into
         the password hash: H(salt, pw).
        *Where does the salt value come from? It's
         stored on the server in plaintext.
        *Q: Why is this better if the adversary
            can compromise the salt too?
         A: The attacker cannot use a single
            rainbow table to check for hash
            matches---the same password with
            different salts will have a different
            hash value!
        *Best practices:
             -Choose a long random salt.
             -Choose a fresh salt each time user
              changes password.</p>

<p>How should a client transmit a password to
a server?
  -Bad idea: send the password in the clear.
  -Slightly better: send password over an
   encrypted connection.
        *Drawback: Connection may be intercepted
         by an attacker who pretends to be the
         server (encryption doesn't necessarily
         mean that the server has authenticated
         to the client!). MITM attacker can then
         use the stolen password to impersonate
         the user.
       *Q: What if client sends the hash of the
           password instead of the raw password?
        A: Doesn't provide us with any extra
           power, since the hash can still be
           replayed by the attacker.
        Encryption and hashing do not automatically
        add security---you need to think about
        what security properties you want to
        achieve, and specific ways that encryption
        and hashing can achieve those goals.
  -Better idea: Challenge/response protocol.
       Client             Server
            Hi, I'm Alice.
           ----------------></p>

<pre><code>          Challenge C
       &lt;----------------

        H(C || password)
       -----------------&gt;
                     -Server checks whether the
                      response is H(C || password).

    *Ignoring MITM, the server is now confident
     that the user is Alice.
    *If server is an attacker and didn't
     already know password, the attacker
     still doesn't know password.
            -Q: How can we prevent server from
             brute-force guessing password
             based on H() value?
             A1: Expensive hash + salting.
             A2: Allow client to choose some
                 randomness too: guard against
                 rainbow tables.
    *To avoid storing the real password on the
     server, use a protocol like SRP:
         http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol
     High-level idea: Given a security parameter
     g, the client computes this . . .
          v = g^(hash(salt, password))
     . . . and sends v and the salt to the
     server. The client and the server can
     then establish an ephemeral key with
     their shared knowledge of g and v
     (protocol takes advantage of the fact
     that it's difficult for the attacker to
     perform discrete logarithms modulo N;
     RSA also takes advantage of this
     observation).
    *Implementing challenge/response often
     means changing the client and the server.
</code></pre>

<p>To prevent brute force attacks, we can implement
anti-hammering defenses.
   -Ex: Rate-limit the number of password guesses;
    implement time-out periods after too many
    incorrect guesses.
   -It's really important to throttle guess rate
    because passwords have so little entropy!
        *Many sites impose requirements on
         passwords (e.g., length, the use of
         special chars like punctuation).
        *In reality, what matters is entropy!
         Format requirements rarely translate
         into higher entropy.
        *A competent dictionary attacker can
         model password constraints and still
         generate rainbow tables; even with
         constraints, people will still pick
         passwords that adhere to a priori
         character distributions. 
        *Telepathwords: https://telepathwords.research.microsoft.com/
         As you type in a potential password
         letter, tries to guess the next letter
         using heuristics!
              -Common passwords (e.g., via leaks
               of password databases)
              -Popular phrases from web sites
              -Common user biases in selecting
               characters (e.g., using adjacent
               keys for adjacent password
               characters)
   -Kerberos v4, and v5 without preauth were
    vulnerable to offline guessing
    [http://www.gnu.org/software/shishi/wu99realworld.pdf]
        *Anyone could ask the KDC for a ticket
         encrypted with the user's password, i.e.,
         the KDC did not authenticate requests
         (although the response would be encrypted
         with K<em>c).
        *Attacker can try brute-force to guess
         the user's password---this is easy to
         parallelize. Since the ticket-granting-ticket
         has a known format, the attacker can
         determine when a decryption is successful.
        *In Kerberos v5, ticket requestor must
         include { timestamp }</em>{K<em>c} along with
         request, to prove knowledge of K</em>c.</p>

<p>Password recovery is extremely important, but
often overlooked.
   -People often focus on the entropy of passwords,
    but if recovery questions can be used to reset
    passwords, the strength of a password authentication
    scheme is min(password<em>entropy,
                  recovery</em>question_entropy).
   -Recovery questions are often easily guessable.
    In one famous example, somebody got access to
    Sarah Palin's Yahoo address by guessing answers
    to her security questions.
         *Intrinsically low entropy ("What's
          your favorite color?" "What's the
          name of your best friend?")
         *Answers leaked via social media
          profiles ("What's your favorite
          movie?")
         *Self-generated questions are typically
          easy to answer ("What is 5 + 5?")</p>

<p>In the reading for today, the authors propose
a bunch of factors that can be used to evaluate
authentication schemes (the goal is to determine
whether passwords are as bad as they seem). The
authors consider three high-level metrics:
usability, deployability, and security.
   -Usability: How easy is it for users to
    interact with the authentication scheme?
        *Easy-to-Learn: "Users who don't know
         the scheme can figure it out and learn
         it without too much trouble."
              -This is a key reason why password
               schemes are so popular!
        *Infrequent errors: "The task that users
         must perform to log in usually succeeds
         when performed by a legitimate and
         honest user."
              -This is an important reason why
               users pick easy-to-guess passwords.
        *Scalable-for-Users: "Using the scheme
         for hundreds of accounts does not
         increase the burden on the user."
              -. . . explains why people often
               reuse passwords or create a simple
               per-site uniquifying scheme for a
               base password.
        *Easy recovery from loss of the
         authentication token
              -A win for passwords--they're easy
               to reset.
        *Nothing to carry
              -Another win for passwords.
   -Deployability: How easy is it to incorporate
    the authentication method into real systems?
        *Server-Compatible: "At the verifier's end,
         the scheme is compatible with text-based
         passwords. Providers don't have to change
         their existing authentication setup to
         support the scheme."
        *Browser-Compatible: "Users don't have
         to change their client to support the
         scheme . . . schemes fail to provide
         this benefit if they require the
         installation of plugins or any kind of
         software whose installation requires
         administrative privileges."
        *Accessible: "Users who can use passwords
         are not prevented from using the scheme
         by disabilities or other physical (not
         cognitive) conditions."</p>

<pre><code>    *Deployability is extremely difficult:
     it's difficult to get users or servers
     to update en masse!
    *Passwords do well in this category by
     default, since the authors define
     "deployability" as how well a system
     integrates with current password
     infrastructure. However, passwords
     don't do very well in the next
     category . . .
</code></pre>

<p>-Security: What kinds of attacks can the
    authentication scheme prevent?
        *Resilient-to-Physical-Observation: "An
         attacker cannot impersonate a user after
         observing them authenticate one or more
         times. We grant Quasi-Resilient-to-
         Physical-Observation if the scheme could
         be broken only by repeating the observation
         more than, say, 10--20 times. Attacks
         include shoulder surfing, filming the
         keyboard, recording keystroke sounds, or
         thermal imaging of keypad."
                 -Passwords fail this test, since,
                  e.g., they can be captured by
                  filming the keyboard or recording
                  keystroke sounds.
        *Resilient-to-Targeted-Impersonation: "It
         is not possible for an acquanitance (or
         skilled investigator) to impersonate a
         specific user by exploiting knowledge of
         personal details (birth date, names of
         relatives etc.). Personal knowledge
         questions are the canonical scheme that
         fails on this point."
                 -The authors say that passwords
                  are "quasi-resistant" b/c they
                  couldn't find any studies saying
                  that your friends or acquaintances
                  can easily guess your password.
        *Resilient-to-Throttled-Guessing: "An
         attacker whose rate of guessing is
         constrained by the verifier cannot
         successfully guess the secrets of a
         significant fraction of users . . .
         Lack of this benefit is meant to
         penalize schemes in which it is frequent
         for user-chosen secrets to be selected
         from a small and well-known subset."
                 -Passwords fail because they
                  have low entropy + skewed
                  distributions.
        *Resilient-to-Unthrottled-Guessing: "An
         attacker whose rate of guessing is
         constrained only by available computing
         resources cannot successfully guess the
         secrets of a significant fraction of users.
         We might for example grant this benefit if
         an attacker capable of attempting up to 2^40
         or even 2^64 guesses per account could
         still only reach fewer than 1% of accounts.
         Lack of this benefit is meant to penalize
         schemes where the space of credentials is
         not large enough to withstand brute force
         search from a small and well-known subset."
                 -Passwords fail because they
                  have low entropy + skewed
                  distributions.
        *Resilient-to-Internal-Observation: "An
         attacker cannot impersonate a user by
         intercepting the user's input from inside
         the user's device (e.g., by keylogging
         malware) or eavesdropping on the cleartext
         communication between prover and verifier
         (we assume that the attacker can also
         defeat TLS if it is used, perhaps through
         the CA) . . . This penalizes schemes that
         are not replay-resistant, whether because
         they send a static response or because
         their dynamic response countermeasure can
     be cracked with a few observations. This
         benefit assumes that general-purpose devices
         like software-updatable personal computers
         and mobile phones may contain malware,
         but that hardware devices dedicated
         exclusively to the scheme can be made
         malware-free."
                 -Passwords fail because they
                  are static tokens: once you
                  have one, you can use it until
                  it expires or is revoked.
        *Resilient-to-Phishing: "An attacker who
         simulates a valid verifier (including
         by DNS manipulation) cannot collect
         credentials that can later be used to
         impersonate the user to the actual verifier.
         This penalizes schemes allowing phishers
         to get victims to authenticate to look-alike
         sites and later use the harvested
         credentials against the genuine sites."
                 -Passwords fail: phishing attacks
                  are very common!
        *No-Trusted-Third-Party: "The scheme does
         not rely on a trusted third party (other
         than the prover and the verifier) who
         could, upon being attacked or otherwise
         becoming untrustworthy, compromise the
         prover's security or privacy."
              -This property makes an important
               point: a lot of authentication
               problems would become easier if
               we could just trust one party
               to store passwords, run the password
               servers, etc. However, single
               points of failure are bad, since
               attackers can focus all of their
               energy on that point!
        *Resilient-to-Leaks-from-Other-Verifiers:
         "Nothing that a verifier could possibly
         leak can help an attacker impersonate the
         user to another verifier. This penalizes
         schemes where insider fraud at one
         provider, or a successful attack on one
         back-end, endangers the user's accounts
         at other sites."
              -This property is related to
               No-Trusted-Third-Party. To avoid
               a central point of failure, we'd
               like to introduced some notion
               of distributed authentication:
               however, does this mean that the
               system is only as strong as its
               weakest link? [Think back to HTTPS,
               and how a bad certificate authority
               can convince a browser to accept
               fake certificates for arbitrary
               sites. Security depends on the
               strength of the least secure CA!]
              -Authors say that passwords fail
               because people often reuse passwords
               across sites.</p>

<p>Biometrics: Leverage the unique aspects of a
person's physical appearance or behavior.
   -How big is the keyspace?
        Fingerprints: ~13.3 bits.
        Iris scan: ~19.9 bits.
        Voice recognition: ~11.7 bits.
    So, bits of entropy are roughly the same
    as passwords.</p>

<p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA): defense using
depth.
   -Requires users to authenticate themselves using
    two or more authentication mechanisms.
   -The mechanisms should involve different modalities!
        *Something you know (e.g., a password)
        *Something you possess (e.g., a cellphone,
         a hardware token)
        *Something you are (e.g., biometrics)
   -Idea is that an attacker must steal/subvert
    multiple authentication mechanisms to
    impersonate a user (e.g., attacker might guess
    a password, but lack access to a user's phone).
   -Example: Google's two-factor authentication
    requires a password plus a cellphone which
    can receive authorization codes via text
    message.
   -Example: AWS two-factor authentication requires
    a password and an "MFA device" (a smartphone
    running an authentication app, or a
    special-purpose security token or security
    card).
    [http://aws.amazon.com/iam/details/mfa/]
   -MFA is a good idea, but empirical studies
    show that if users are given a second
    authentication factor in addition to
    passwords, users pick much weaker passwords!</p>

<p>What are potential answers to the homework
questions? What factors matter?
   -Logging into public Athena machine?
        *Resilient-to-Internal-Observation: easy to
         install malware on machine.
        *Resilient-to-Physical-Observation?
        *MIT IDs could be a good thing to leverage
         (use them as a smartcard).
        *Biometrics? Untrusted terminals, probably
         not a great plan.
   -Accessing Facebook from Internet cafe?
        *Password managers not a good idea here.
        *How sensitive is the data?
              -Might be leveraged to authenticate
               to other sites! [Either "Login with
               Facebook" or by answering personal
               security questions to reset a
               password.]
   -Withdrawing cash from ATM?
        *Security matters highly.
               Resilient-to-Physical-Observation.
               Resilient-to-Theft.
        *Possibly trusted terminal: biometrics
         might be worth considering. [However,
         in practice, bank may not want to
         trust the terminals.]
        *You also might care about authenticating
         individual transactions!
              -Prevent the adversary from using
               stolen credentials for different,
               attacker-chosen operations.
              -Ex: Maybe user can examine balance
               using just a password, but if she
               wants to withdraw money, she uses
               two-factor authentication using
               her phone.</p>

<p>Conclusion of paper: There is no authentication
scheme which clearly dominates passwords! For
example, according to the authors, the CAP
reader has perfect scores on security!
   -The CAP reader was designed by Mastercard
    to protect online banking transactions.
   -Usage:
        1)Put your credit card into the CAP
          reader (which looks like a hand-held
          calculator).
        2)Enter PIN (bypassing keyloggers!).
        3)Reader talks to the card's embedded
          processor, outputs an 8-digit code
          which the user supplies to the
          web site.</p>

<pre><code>                    CAP reader
Easy-to-learn:      Yes
Infrequent errors:  Quasi-yes
Scalable for users: No (users require card+PIN per verifier)
Easy recovery:      No
Nothing to carry:   No
                         1.5

                    CAP reader
</code></pre>

<p>Server-compatible:   No
   Browser-compatible:  Yes
   Accessible:          No (blind people can't read 8-digit code)
                              1</p>

<pre><code>                    CAP reader
</code></pre>

<p>Res-to-Phys-Obs:        Yes\
Res-to-Trgtd-Imp:       Yes __ One-time codes!
Res-to-Thrtld-Guess:    Yes /
Res-to-UnThrtld-Guess:  Yes/
Res-to-Internal-Obv:    Yes     Dedicated device
Res-to-Phishing:        Yes     One-time codes
No-trusted-3rd-Party:   Yes     Each site is its own verifier
Res-Other-Ver-Leaks:    Yes     One-time codes
                              8
   -So, passwords=8 and CAP reader=10.5. However,
    there are reasons why CAP readers haven't
    taken over the world (see the low usability
    and deployability scores).
   -In practice, deployability and usability are
    often more important than security.
         *Migration costs (coding+debugging effort,
          user training) make developers nervous!
         *The less usable a scheme is, the more
          that users will complain (and try to
          pick easier authentication tokens that
          are more vulnerable to attackers).
   -Some situations may assign different weights
    to different evaluation metrics.
         *Ex: On a military base, the security
          benefits of a hardware-based token might
          outweigh the problems with usability
          and deployability.</p>
