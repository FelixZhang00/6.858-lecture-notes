<h1>Buffer overflows, baggy bounds</h1>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> These lecture notes were slightly modified from the ones posted on the 6.858 <a href="http://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2014/schedule.html">course website</a> from 2014.</p>

<h2>Review of buffer overflow attacks</h2>

<p>Last lecture, we looked at the basics of performing a
buffer overflow attack. That attack leveraged several
observations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Systems software is often written in C (operating
systems, file systems, databases, compilers, network
servers, command shells and console utilities)</li>
<li>C is essentially high-level assembly, so...
<ul>
<li>Exposes raw pointers to memory</li>
<li>Does not perform bounds-checking on arrays
(b/c the hardware doesn't do this, and C
wants to get you as close to the hardware
as possible)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Attack also leveraged architectural knowledge about
how x86 code works:
<ul>
<li>The direction that the stack grows</li>
<li>Layout of stack variables (esp. arrays and
return addresses for functions)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><code>read_req.c:</code></p>

<pre><code>    void read_req() {
      char buf[128];
      int i;
      gets(buf);
      //. . . do stuff w/buf . . .
    }
</code></pre>

<p>What does the compiler generate in terms of memory layout? x86 stack looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>  %esp points to the last (bottom-most) valid thing on
  the stack.

  %ebp points to the caller's %esp value.

                     +------------------+
    entry %ebp ----&gt; | .. prev frame .. |
                     |                  |  |
                     |                  |  | stack grows down
                     +------------------+  |
    entry %esp ----&gt; |  return address  |  v
                     +------------------+
    new %ebp ------&gt; |    saved %ebp    |
                     +------------------+
                     |     buf[127]     |
                     |       ...        |
                     |      buf[0]      |
                     +------------------+
    new %esp ------&gt; |        i         |
                     +------------------+
</code></pre>

<p>How does the adversary take advantage of this code?</p>

<ul>
<li>Supply long input, overwrite data on stack past buffer.</li>
<li><strong>Key observation 1:</strong> attacker can overwrite the <em>return
address</em>, make the program jump to a place of the
attacker's choosing!</li>
<li><strong>Key observation 2:</strong> attacker can set return address to
the buffer itself, include some x86 code in there!</li>
</ul>

<p>What can the attackers do once they are executing code?</p>

<ul>
<li>Use any privileges of the process! If the process is
running as root or Administrator, it can do whatever
it wants on the system. Even if the process is not
running as root, it can send spam, read files, and
interestingly, attack or subvert other machines behind
the firewall.</li>
<li>Hmmm, but why didn't the OS notice that the buffer has
been overrun?
<ul>
<li>As far as the OS is aware, nothing strange has
happened! Remember that, to a first approximation,
the OS only gets invoked by the web server when
the server does IO or IPC. Other than that, the
OS basically sits back and lets the program execute,
relying on hardware page tables to prevent processes
from tampering with each other's memory. However,
page table protections don't prevent buffer overruns
launched by a process "against itself," since the
overflowed buffer and the return address and all of
that stuff are inside the process's valid address
space.</li>
<li>Later in this lecture, we'll talk about things
that the OS <em>can</em> do to make buffer overflows
more difficult.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Fixing buffer overflows</h2>

<p><strong>Approach #1:</strong> Avoid bugs in C code.</p>

<ul>
<li>Hard / impossible to achieve.</li>
<li>Programmer should carefully check sizes of buffers,
strings, arrays, etc. In particular, the programmer
should use standard library functions that take
buffer sizes into account (<code>strncpy()</code> instead of <code>strcpy()</code>,
<code>fgets()</code> instead of <code>gets()</code>, etc.).</li>
<li>Modern versions of <code>gcc</code> and Visual Studio warn you when
a program uses unsafe functions like gets(). In general,
<strong>YOU SHOULD NOT IGNORE COMPILER WARNINGS.</strong> Treat warnings
like errors!</li>
<li><strong>Good:</strong> Avoid problems in the first place!</li>
<li><strong>Bad:</strong> It's hard to ensure that code is bug-free, particularly
if the code base is large. Also, the application itself may
define buffer manipulation functions which do not use <code>fgets()</code>
or <code>strcpy()</code> as primitives.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Approach #2:</strong> Build tools to help programmers find bugs.</p>

<ul>
<li>For example, we can use static analysis to find problems in
source code before it's compiled. Imagine that you had a
function like this:</li>
</ul>

<p><code>foo.c:</code></p>

<pre><code>    void foo(int *p) {
        int offset;
        int *z = p + offset;
        if(offset &gt; 7){
            bar(offset);
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>By statically analyzing the control flow, we can tell
that offset is used without being initialized.</li>
<li>The <code>if</code>-statement also puts bounds on offset that we may
be able to propagate to bar.</li>
<li>We'll talk about static analysis more in later lectures.</li>
<li><em>"Fuzzers"</em> that supply random inputs can be effective for
finding bugs. Note that fuzzing can be combined with static
analysis to maximize code coverage!</li>
<li><strong>Bad:</strong> Difficult to prove the complete absence of bugs, esp.
for unsafe code like C.</li>
<li><strong>Good:</strong> Even partial analysis is useful, since programs should
become strictly less buggy. For example, baggy bounds checking
cannot catch all memory errors, but it can detect many 
important kinds.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Approach #3:</strong> Use a memory-safe language (JavaScript, C#, Python).</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Good:</strong> Prevents memory corruption errors by not exposing raw
memory addresses to the programmer, and by automatically
handling garbage collection.</li>
<li><strong>Bad:</strong> Low-level runtime code <strong>does</strong> use raw memory addresses.
So, that runtime core still needs to be correct. For example,
<em>heap spray attacks</em>:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/sec09/tech/full_papers/ratanaworabhan.pdf">NOZZLE: A Defense Against Heap-spraying Code Injection Attacks</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.corelan.be/index.php/2011/12/31/exploit-writing-tutorial-part-11-heap-spraying-demystified/">Exploit writing tutorial part 11 : Heap Spraying Demystified</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Bad:</strong> Still have a lot of legacy code in unsafe languages (FORTRAN and COBOL 
oh noes).</li>
<li><strong>Bad:</strong> Maybe you need access to low-level hardware features
(e.g., you're writing a device driver)</li>
<li><strong>Bad:</strong> Perf. is worse than a fine-tuned C application?
<ul>
<li>Used to be a bigger problem, but hardware and
high-level languages are getting better.
<ul>
<li>JIT compilation FTW!</li>
<li><a href="http://asmjs.org/faq.html">asm.js</a> is within 2x of native C++ performance!     </li>
<li>Use careful coding to avoid garbage collection
jitter in critical path.</li>
<li>Maybe you're a bad person / <em>language chauvinist</em>
who doesn't know how to pick the right tool
for the job. If your task is I/O-bound, raw
compute speed is much less important. Also,
don't be the chump who writes text manipulation
programs in C.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>All 3 above approaches are effective and widely used, but
buffer overflows are still a problem in practice.</p>

<ul>
<li>Large/complicated legacy code written in C is very prevalent.</li>
<li>Even newly written code in C/C++ can have memory errors.</li>
</ul>

<p>How can we mitigate buffer overflows despite buggy code?</p>

<ul>
<li>Two things going on in a "traditional" buffer overflow:
<ul>
<li>Adversary gains control over execution (program counter).</li>
<li>Adversary executes some malicious code.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What are the difficulties to these two steps?
<ul>
<li>Requires overwriting a code pointer (which is later invoked).
Common target is a return address using a buffer on the stack.
Any memory error could potentially work, in practice.
Function pointers, C++ vtables, exception handlers, etc.</li>
<li>Requires some interesting code in process's memory.
This is often easier than #1, because:
<ul>
<li>it's easy to put code in a buffer, and</li>
<li>the process already contains a lot of code that
might be exploitable.</li>
<li>however, the attacker needs to put this code in a
predictable location, so that the attacker can set the
code pointer to point to the evil code!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Mitigation approach 1: canaries (e.g., StackGuard, gcc's SSP)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Idea: OK to overwrite code pointer, as long as we catch it before
invocation.</li>
<li>One of the earlier systems: StackGuard
<ul>
<li>Place a canary on the stack upon entry, check canary value
before return.</li>
<li>Usually requires source code; compiler inserts canary 
checks.</li>
<li><strong>Q:</strong> Where is the canary on the stack diagram?
<strong>A:</strong> Canary must go "in front of" return address on the
stack, so that any overflow which rewrites return
address will also rewrite canary.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><code>stack layout:</code></p>

<pre><code>                     |                  |
                     +------------------+
    entry %esp ----&gt; |  return address  |    ^
                     +------------------+    |
    new %ebp ------&gt; |    saved %ebp    |    |
                     +------------------+    |
                     |     CANARY       |    | Overflow goes
                     +------------------+    | this way.
                     |     buf[127]     |    |
                     |       ...        |    |
                     |      buf[0]      |    |
                     +------------------+
                     |                  |
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><strong>Q:</strong> Suppose that the compiler always made the canary
4 bytes of the <code>'a'</code> character. What's wrong with this?</li>
<li><strong>A:</strong> Adversary can include the appropriate canary value
in the buffer overflow!</li>
<li>So, the canary must be either hard to guess, or it
can be easy to guess but still resilient against
buffer overflows. Here are examples of these approaches.
<ul>
<li><em>"Terminator canary"</em>: four bytes (0, CR, LF, -1)</li>
<li>Idea: Many C functions treat these characters
as terminators(e.g., <code>gets()</code>, <code>sprintf()</code>). As a
result, if the canary matches one of these
terminators, then further writes won't happen.</li>
<li>Random canary generated at program init time:
Much more common today (but, you need good
randomness!).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>What kinds of vulnerabilities will a stack canary not catch?</p>

<ul>
<li>Overwrites of function pointer variables before the canary.</li>
<li>Attacker can overwrite a data pointer, then leverage it to
do arbitrary mem writes.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>data pointer example:</code></p>

<pre><code>    int *ptr = ...;
    char buf[128];
    gets(buf);  // Buffer is overflowed, and overwrites ptr.
    *ptr = 5;   // Writes to an attacker-controlled address!
              // Canaries can't stop this kind of thing.
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Heap object overflows (function pointers, C++ vtables).</li>
<li><code>malloc</code>/<code>free</code> overflows</li>
</ul>

<p><code>malloc example:</code></p>

<pre><code>    int main(int argc, char **argv) {
        char *p, *q;

        p = malloc(1024);
        q = malloc(1024);
        if(argc &gt;= 2)
            strcpy(p, argv[1]);
        free(q);
        free(p);
        return 0;
    }
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Assume that the two blocks of memory belonging
to <code>p</code> and <code>q</code> are adjacent/nearby in memory.</li>
<li>Assume that <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code> represent memory blocks
like this:</li>
</ul>

<p><code>malloc memory blocks:</code></p>

<pre><code>        +----------------+  
        |                |     
        |   App data     |     
        |                |      Allocated memory block
        +----------------+     
        |   size         |     
        +----------------+  


        +----------------+
        |   size         |
        +----------------+
        |  ...empty...   |
        +----------------+  
        |   bkwd ptr     |     
        +----------------+          
        |   fwd ptr      |      Free memory block
        +----------------+     
        |   size         |     
        +----------------+
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>So, the buffer overrun in <code>p</code> will overwrite the
size value in <code>q</code>'s memory block! Why is this a
problem?
<ul>
<li>When <code>free()</code> merges two adjacent free blocks,
it needs to manipulate <code>bkwd</code> and <code>fwd</code> pointers...</li>
<li>...and the pointer calculation uses
size to determine where the free memory
block structure lives!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><code>free() internals:</code></p>

<pre><code>    p = get_free_block_struct(size);
    bck = p-&gt;bk;
    fwd = p-&gt;fd;
    fwd-&gt;bk = bck;  // Writes memory!
    bck-&gt;fd = fwd;  // Writes memory!
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>The free memory block is represented as a C
 <code>struct</code>; by corrupting the size value, the
 attacker can force <code>free()</code> to operate on a
 fake <code>struct</code> that resides in attacker-controlled
 memory and has attacker-controlled values
 for the forward and backwards pointers.</li>
<li>If the attacker knows how <code>free()</code> updates
 the pointers, he can use that update code
 to write an arbitrary value to an arbitrary
 place. For example, the attacker can overwrite
 a return address.
<ul>
<li>Actual details are a bit more complicated; if you're
interested in gory details, go 
<a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/hh/hh-11.html">here</a></li>
<li>The high-level point is that stack canaries won't
prevent this attack, because the attacker is "skipping
over" the canary and writing directly to the return
address!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Mitigation approach 2: bounds checking</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Overall goal:</strong> prevent pointer misuse by checking if pointers
are in range.</li>
<li><strong>Challenge:</strong> In C, it can be hard to differentiate between
a valid pointer and an invalid pointer. For example,
suppose that a program allocates an array of characters...
<code>char x[1024];</code></li>
<li>... as well as a pointer to some place in that array, e.g., <code>char *y = &amp;x[107];</code></li>
<li>Is it OK to increment <code>y</code> to access subsequent elements?
<ul>
<li>If <code>x</code> represents a string buffer, maybe yes.</li>
<li>If <code>x</code> represents a network message, maybe no.</li>
<li>Life is even more complicated if the program uses unions.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><code>union example:</code></p>

<pre><code>    union u{
        int i;
        struct s{
            int j;
            int k;
        };
    };

    int *ptr = &amp;(u.s.k); // Does this point to valid data?
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><strong>The problem</strong> is that, in C, <em>a pointer does not encode 
information about the intended usage semantics for that 
pointer.</em></li>
<li>So, a lot of tools don't try to guess those semantics. 
Instead, the tools have a less lofty goal than "totally 
correct" pointer semantics: the tools just enforce the
memory bounds on heap objects and stack objects. At a high 
level, here's the goal:
<ul>
<li>For a pointer <code>p'</code> that's derived from <code>p</code>, <code>p'</code> should only
be dereferenced to access the valid memory region that
belongs to <code>p</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Enforcing memory bounds</em> is a <strong>weaker</strong> goal than <em>enforcing
"totally correct" pointer semantics</em>. Programs can still shoot
themselves in the foot by trampling on their memory in nasty
ways (e.g., in the union example, the application may write
to pointer even though it's not defined).</li>
<li>However, bounds checking is still useful because it prevents
<em>arbitrary</em> memory overwrites. The program can only trample
its memory if that memory is actually allocated! <em>THIS IS
CONSIDERED PROGRESS IN THE WORLD OF C.</em></li>
<li>A drawback of bounds checking is that it typically requires
changes to the compiler, and programs must be recompiled with
the new compiler. This is a problem if you only have access
to binaries.</li>
</ul>

<h4>What are some approaches for implementing bounds checking?</h4>

<p><strong>Bounds checking approach #1: Electric fences</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>These are an old approach that had the virtue of being simple.</li>
<li><strong>Idea:</strong> Align each heap object with a guard page, and use page
tables to ensure that accesses to the guard page cause a 
fault.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>electric fence:</code></p>

<pre><code>    +---------+
    | Guard   |
    |         |  ^
    +---------+  | Overflows cause a page exception
    |  Heap   |  |
    |  obj    |  |
    +---------+
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>This is a convenient debugging technique, since a heap 
overflow will immediately cause a crash, as opposed to 
silently corrupting the heap and causing a failure at some 
indeterminate time in the future.</li>
<li>Big advantage: Works without source code: don't need to
change compilers or recompile programs! 
<ul>
<li>You <em>do</em> need to relink them so that they use a new version of <code>malloc</code>
which implements electric fences.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Big disadvantage: Huge overhead! There's only one object
per page, and you have the overhead of a dummy page which
isn't used for "real" data.</li>
<li>Summary: Electric fences can be useful as debugging technique,
and they can prevent some buffer overflows for heap objects.
However, electric fences can't protect the stack, and the
memory overhead is too high to use in production systems.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bounds checking approach #2: Fat pointer</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Idea:</strong> Modify the pointer representation to include bounds 
information. Now, a pointer includes a memory address and 
bounds information about an object that lives in that memory 
region.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>example:</code></p>

<pre><code>    Regular 32-bit pointer  
     +-----------------+
     | 4-byte address  |
     +-----------------+

    Fat pointer (96 bits)
     +-----------------+----------------+---------------------+
     | 4-byte obj_base | 4-byte obj_end | 4-byte curr_address |
     +-----------------+----------------+---------------------+
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>You need to modify the compiler and recompile the 
programs to use the fat pointers. The compiler
generates code to abort the program if it dereferences
a pointer whose address is outside of its own
<code>base ... end</code> range.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>example:</code></p>

<pre><code>        int *ptr = malloc(sizeof(int) * 2);
        while(1){
            *ptr = 42;       &lt;----------|
            ptr++;                      |
        }                               |
          ______________________________|
         |

    This line checks the current address of the pointer and
    ensures that it's in-bounds. Thus, this line will fail
    during the third iteration of the loop.
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><strong>Problem #1:</strong> It can be expensive to check all pointer
dereferences. The C community hates things that are
expensive, because C is all about SPEED SPEED SPEED.</li>
<li><strong>Problem #2:</strong> Fat pointers are incompatible with a lot of
existing software.
<ul>
<li>You can't pass a fat pointer to an unmodified library.</li>
<li>You can't use fat pointers in fixed-size data
structures. For example, <code>sizeof(that_struct)</code>
will change!</li>
<li><em>Updates to fat pointers are not atomic</em>, because they span
multiple words. Some programs assume that pointer writes
are atomic.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>Bounds checking approach #3: Shadown data structures</h4>

<p><strong>Idea:</strong> Use shadow data structures to keep track of bounds information 
(<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.42.3156">Jones and Kelly</a>, <a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/sec09/tech/full_papers/akritidis.pdf">Baggy bounds</a>).</p>

<ul>
<li>For each allocated object, store how big the object is. For example:
<ul>
<li>Record the value passed to malloc:
<ul>
<li><code>char *p = malloc(mem_size);</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>For static variables, the values are determined by the compiler:
<ul>
<li><code>char p[256];</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>For each pointer, we need to interpose on two operations:
<ol>
<li>pointer arithmetic: <code>char *q = p + 256;</code></li>
<li>pointer dereferencing: <code>char ch = *q;</code></li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Q:</strong> Why do we need to interpose on dereference? Can't we do
just arithmetic?</li>
<li><strong>A:</strong> An invalid pointer isn't always a bug! For example,
a pointer to one element past the last item of an
array might be used as a stopping test in a loop.
Applications can also do goofy stuff like:
<ul>
<li>Simulating 1-indexed arrays</li>
<li>Computing p+(a-b) as (p+a)-b</li>
<li>Generating OOB pointers that are later checked for validity</li>
</ul></li>
<li>So, the mere creation of invalid pointer shouldn't cause
program to fail.</li>
<li><strong>Q:</strong> Why do we need to interpose on arithmetic? Can't we do
just dereference?</li>
<li><strong>A:</strong> Interposing on arithmetic is what allows us to track
the provenance of pointers and set the OOB bit. Without
the OOB, we won't be able to tell when a derived pointer
goes outside of the bounds of its base object.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Challenge 1:</strong> How do we find the bounds information for a
regular pointer, i.e., a pointer that's in-bounds?
<ul>
<li><em>Naive:</em> Use a hash table or interval tree to map addresses
to bounds.
<ul>
<li>Good: Space efficient (only store info for in-use pointers,
not all possible addresses).</li>
<li>Bad: Slow lookup (multiple memory accesses per look-up).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Naive:</em> Use an array to store bounds info for <em>every</em> memory
address.
<ul>
<li>Good: Fast!</li>
<li>Bad: Really high memory overhead. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Challenge 2:</strong> How do we force out-of-bounds pointer 
dereferences to fail?
<ul>
<li><em>Naive:</em> Instrument every pointer dereference.
<ul>
<li>Good: Uh, it works.</li>
<li>Bad: Expensive. We have to execute extra code for
every dereference!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>The baggy bounds approach: 5 tricks</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Trick 1:</strong> Round up each allocation to a power of 2, and align the
start of the allocation to that power of 2.</li>
<li><strong>Trick 2:</strong> Express each range limit as <code>log_2(alloc_size).</code>
<ul>
<li>For 32-bit pointers, only need 5 bits to express
the possible ranges: we can only allocate objects of a
set of 32 different sizes: <code>2^1 = 2 bytes, 2^2 = 4 bytes
..., 2^31 bytes or 2^32 bytes</code>, and we store the log base 2
of the allocation size, which is a number between 1 and 32, 
so we only need 5 bits for it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Trick 3:</strong> Store limit info in a linear array: fast lookup with
one byte per entry. Also, we can use virtual memory to
allocate the array on-demand!</li>
<li><strong>Trick 4:</strong> Allocate memory at slot granularity (e.g., 16 bytes):
<strong>fewer array entries.</strong>
<ul>
<li>That means <strong>min. alloc. size</strong> is 16 bytes</li>
<li>...and, since pointers will be aligned to their allocation 
size boundary, it means the last 4 bits of the pointer are all zero</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><code>example:</code></p>

<pre><code>    slot_size = 16

    p = malloc(16);  --&gt;  table[p/slot_size] = 4;
    p = malloc(32);  --&gt;  table[p/slot_size] = 5;
                     \-&gt;  table[(p/slot_size) + 1] = 5;
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><strong>Trick 4 (continued):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Now, given a known good pointer <code>p</code>, and a derived
pointer <code>p'</code>, we can test whether <code>p'</code> is valid by
checking whether both pointers have the same
prefix in their address bits, and they only differ
in their <code>e</code> least significant bits, where <code>e</code> is equal
to the logarithm of the <em>allocation size</em>. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><code>example:</code></p>

<pre><code>    C code
    ------ 
    p' = p + i;

    Bounds check
    ------------
    size = 1 &lt;&lt; table[p &gt;&gt; log_of_slot_size];
    base = p &amp; ~(size - 1);
    (p' &gt;= base) &amp;&amp; ((p' - base) &lt; size)

    Optimized bounds check
    ----------------------
    (p^p') &gt;&gt; table[p &gt;&gt; log_of_slot_size] == 0
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><strong>Trick 5:</strong> Use virtual memory system to prevent out-of-bound 
derefs: set most significant bit in an OOB pointer,
and then mark pages in the upper half of the address
space as inaccessible. So, we don't have to instrument 
pointer dereferences to prevent bad memory accesses!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example code</strong> (assume that <code>slot_size=16</code>):</p>

<pre><code>    char *p = malloc(44);     //Note that the nearest power of 2 (i.e.,
                              //64 bytes) are allocated. So, there are
                              //64/(slot_size) = 4 bounds table entries
                              //that are set to log_2(64) = 6.

    char *q = p + 60;         //This access is ok: It's past p's object
                              //size of 44, but still within the baggy
                              //bounds of 64.
    char *r = q + 16;         //r is now at an offset of 60+16=76 from
                              //p. This means that r is (76-64)=12 bytes
                              //beyond the end of p. This is more than
                              //half a slot away, so baggy bounds will
                              //raise an error.

    char *s = q + 8;          //s is now at an offset of 60+8=68 from p.
                              //So, s is only 4 bytes beyond the baggy
                              //bounds, which is les than half a slot
                              //away. No error is raised, but the OOB
                              //high-order bit is set in s, so that s
                              //cannot be dereferenced.
    char *t = s - 32;         //t is now back inside the bounds, so
                              //the OOB bit is cleared.
</code></pre>

<p>For OOB pointers, the high bit is set (if OOB within half a slot).
  - Typically, OS kernel lives in upper half, protects itself
   via paging hardware.
  - <strong>Q:</strong> Why half a slot for out-of-bounds?</p>

<p>So what's the answer to the homework problem?</p>

<pre><code>    char *p = malloc(256);
    char *q = p + 256;
    char ch = *q;  // Does this raise an exception?
                   // Hint: How big is the baggy bound for p?
</code></pre>

<h4>Baggy bounds paper errata</h4>

<p>Some bugs in the baggy bounds paper:</p>

<ul>
<li>Figure 3, explicit bounds check should generate
the size like this:
<ul>
<li><code>size = 1 &lt;&lt; table[p &gt;&gt; log_of_slot_size]</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Figure 3, optimized bounds check should be:
<ul>
<li><code>(p^p') &gt;&gt; table[p &gt;&gt; log_of_slot_size] == 0</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Figures 5 and 18, pointer arithmetic code should
be either one of the following:
<ul>
<li><code>char *p = &amp;buf[i];</code></li>
<li><code>char *p = buf + i;</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
