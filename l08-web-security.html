<h1>Web security</h1>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> These lecture notes were slightly modified from the ones posted on the 6.858 <a href="http://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2014/schedule.html">course website</a> from 2014.</p>

<h2>What is the web?</h2>

<p>In the old days, it was a
simple client/server architecture (client
was your web browser, server was a machine
on the network that could deliver static
text and images to your browser).</p>

<ul>
<li>In the old days, the server-side was much
more complex than the client-side: browsers
didn't support rich interactivity, but the
server might interface with databases,
other servers, etc.</li>
<li>Because the server was so much more
complicated, "web security" focused on the
server-side. Up to this point, this class
has largely focused on the server-side as
well (e.g., buffer overflows on web servers,
privilege separation in the OKWS server).</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>web has changed</strong>: now the <strong>browser is very
complicated</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: Allows a page to execute client-side
code.</li>
<li><strong>DOM model</strong>: Provides a JavaScript interface to
the page's HTML, allowing the page to add/remove
tags, change their styling, etc.</li>
<li><strong>XMLHttpRequests (AJAX)</strong>: Asynchronous HTTP requests.</li>
<li><strong>Web sockets</strong>: Full-duplex client-server communication
over TCP.</li>
<li><strong>Web workers</strong>: Multi-threading support.</li>
<li><strong>Multimedia support</strong>: <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>, web cams, screen-sharing.</li>
<li><strong>Geolocation</strong>: Browser can determine your location by
examining GPS units. Firefox can also locate you
by passing your WiFi information to the Google
Location Service.</li>
<li><strong><code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> and WebGL</strong>: Bitmap manipulation and
interactive 2D/3D graphics.</li>
<li><strong>Native Client (NaCl)</strong>: Allows browsers to run native code!</li>
</ul>

<p>The web is now a complex platform for distributed
computation! But what does this mean for security?</p>

<ul>
<li>The threat surface is huge!
<ul>
<li>It's over 9000!!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A single web application now spans multiple programming
languages, OSes, hardware platforms. I might be
running Firefox on Windows interacting with a
Linux server running Apache and interfacing with
memcached and MySQL).</li>
<li><p>All of this composition makes it difficult to
verify end-to-end correctness, or even understand
what the system is doing. Ex: Parsing contexts
and content sanitization.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt; var x = 'UNTRUSTED'; &lt;/script&gt;
//Single quote breaks out of JS string
//context into JS context
//
//"&lt;/script&gt;" breaks out of JS context
//into HTML context
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The web specs are incredibly long, very complex,
occasionally contradictory, and constantly evolving.</p>

<ul>
<li>So, browser vendors do something that roughly
resembles the specs and then laugh about it
with their friends.</li>
<li>If you want to understand the horror, go to

</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Client-side web applications</h2>

<p>In this lecture, we're going to <strong>focus on the
client-side of a web application</strong>. In particular,
we're going to focus on how to isolate content
from different providers that has to reside
within the same browser.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Big difference between a web application and
a traditional desktop application: the bits
in a desktop application typically come from
a single vendor (e.g., Microsoft or Apple or
TurboTax), but a single web application contains
content from a bunch of different principals!</p>

<pre><code>       http://foo.com/index.html


+--------------------------------------------+
|  +--------------------------------------+  |
|  |        ad.gif from ads.com           |  |
|  +--------------------------------------+  |
|  +-----------------+ +------------------+  |
|  | Analytics .js   | | jQuery.js from   |  |
|  | from google.com | | from cdn.foo.com |  |

|                                            |
|        HTML (text inputs, buttons)         |
|                                            |
|  +--------------------------------------+  |
|  | Inline .js from foo.com (defines     |  |
|  | event handlers for HTML GUI inputs)  |  |

</code></pre></li>
<li><p><strong>Question:</strong> Which pieces of JavaScript code can
access which pieces of state? For example . . .</p>

<ul>
<li>Can the analytics code from google.com
access state in the jQuery code from
cdn.foo.com? [Seems maybe bad since different
principals wrote the code, but they are
included in the same frame ...]
<ul>
<li>Yes, they can! They will get the same origin.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Can the jQuery code from cdn.foo.com
access state in the inline JavaScript code
defined by foo.com? [They're <em>almost</em> from
the same place ...]
<ul>
<li>Yes, they can. They get the same origin.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Can the analytics code or jQuery access
the HTML text inputs? [We've got to make
that content interactive somehow.]
<ul>
<li>Yes, JS code included in frame can interact
with frame's DOM.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Can JavaScript in the Facebook frame
touch any state in the foo.com frame?
Does it matter that the Facebook frame
is https://, but the foo.com frame is
regular http://?
<ul>
<li>Can only talk to it using <code>postMessage</code></li>
<li>Cannot issue AJAX requests to foo.com</li>
<li>Cannot do anything to the frame</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>To answer these questions, browsers use a security
model called the <strong>same-origin policy</strong>.</p>

<h2>Same-origin policy</h2>

<ul>
<li><em>Vague goal:</em> Two different websites should not
be able to tamper with each other's content.</li>
<li>Easy to state, but tricky to implement.
<ul>
<li>Obviously bad: If I have two different
web sites open, the first site should
not be able to overwrite the visual
display of the second site.</li>
<li>Obviously good: Developers should be
able to create mash-up sites that combine
content from mutually cooperative web sites.
<ul>
<li>Ex: A site that combines Google Map
data with real estate data.</li>
<li>Ex: Advertistements.</li>
<li>Ex: Social media widgets (e.g., the
Facebook "like" button).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hard to say: If a page from web server X
downloads a JavaScript library from a
different server Y, what capabilities
should that script have?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Basic strategy of same-origin policy:</strong> The browser
assigns an origin to every resource in a page,
including JavaScript libraries. JavaScript code
can only access resources that belong to its origin.</li>
<li><strong>Definition of an origin:</strong> <code>scheme + hostname + port</code>
<ul>
<li>For example:
<ul>
<li>http://foo.com/index.html      (http, foo.com, 80 [implicit])</li>
<li>https://foo.com/index.html     (https, foo.com, 443 [implicit])</li>
<li>http://bar.com:8181/index.html (http, bar.com, 8181)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Schemes can be <code>http, https, ftp, file</code>, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Four <strong>main ideas</strong>:
<ol>
<li>Each origin is associated with client-side
resources (e.g., cookies, DOM storage,
a JavaScript namespace, a DOM tree, windows,
a visual display area, network addresses).
<ul>
<li><em>An origin is the moral equivalent of
a UID in the Unix world.</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Each frame gets the origin of its URL. 
<ul>
<li><em>A frame is the moral equivalent of a process
in Unix.</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Scripts included by a frame execute
with the authority of that HTML file's
origin. This is true for both inline
scripts <em>and</em> ones that are pulled from
external domains! 
<ul>
<li>Unix analogy: Running
a binary that's stored in somebody else's
home directory.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Passive content (e.g., images and CSS)
can't execute code, so this content is
given zero authority.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Returning to our example:
<ul>
<li>The Google analytics script and the jQuery
script can access all the resources belonging
to foo.com (e.g., they can read and write
cookies, attach event handlers to buttons,
manipulate the DOM tree, access JavaScript
variables, etc.).</li>
<li>JavaScript code in the Facebook frame
has no access to resources in the foo.com
frame, because the two frames have different
origins. The two frames can only talk via
postMessage(), a JavaScript API that allows
domains to exchange immutable strings.
<ul>
<li>If the two frames <em>were</em> in the same
origin, they could use window.parent
and window.frames[] to directly
interact with each other's JavaScript
state!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>JavaScript code in the Facebook frame cannot
issue an XMLHttpRequest to foo.com's server
[the network is a resource with an origin!] ...</li>
<li>... however, the Facebook frame <em>can</em>
import scripts, CSS, or images from foo.com
(although that content can only update
the Facebook frame, since the content
inherits the authority of the Facebook
origin, not foo.com origin).</li>
<li>The browser checks the type of ad.gif,
determines that ad.gif is a image, and
concludes that the image should receive
no authority at all.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>What happens if the browser mistakenly identifies
the MIME type of an object?</p>

<ul>
<li>Old versions of IE used to do MIME sniffing.
<ul>
<li>Goal: Detect when a web server has given
an incorrect file extension to an object
(e.g., foo.jpg should actually be foo.html).</li>
<li>Mechanism: IE looks at the first 256 bytes
of the file and looks for magic values
which indicate a file type. If there's
a disagreement between the magic values
and the file extension, IE trusts the
file extension.</li>
<li>Problem: Suppose that a page includes
some passive content (e.g., an image)
from an attacker-controlled domain. The
victim page thinks that it's safe to
import passive content, but the attacker
can intentionally put HTML+JavaScript
in the image and execute code in the
victim page!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Moral: Browsers are complex---adding a
well-intentioned feature may cause subtle
and unexpected security bugs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's take a deeper look at how the browser
secures various resources.</p>

<h2>Frame/window objects</h2>

<ul>
<li>Note: A frame object is a DOM node of type
HTMLIFrameElement, whereas the window object
is the alias for the global JavaScript namespace.
<ul>
<li>Both objects have references to each other.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Get the origin of their frame's URLs <br />
       <strong>-OR-</strong> <br />
Get the origin of the <strong>adjusted <code>document.domain</code></strong>
<ul>
<li>A frame's <code>document.domain</code> is originally
derived from the URL in the normal way.</li>
<li>A frame can set <code>document.domain</code> to be
a suffix of the full domain. Ex:
<ul>
<li>x.y.z.com          <code>// Original value</code></li>
<li>y.z.com            <code>// Allowable new value</code></li>
<li>z.com              <code>// Allowable new value</code></li>
<li>a.y.z.com          <strong><code>// Disallowed</code></strong></li>
<li>.com               <strong><code>// Disallowed</code></strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Browsers distinguish between a <code>document.domain</code>
that has been written, and one that has not,
even if both have the same value! </li>
<li><strong>Two frames can access each other if:</strong>
<ol>
<li>They have both set <code>document.domain</code> to
the same value, or</li>
<li>Neither has changed <code>document.domain</code>
(and those values are equal in both frames)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>These rules help protect a site from being
attacked by a buggy/malicious subdomain,
e.g., <code>x.y.z.com</code> trying to attack <code>y.z.com</code>
by shortening its <code>document.domain</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>DOM nodes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Get the origin of their surrounding frame</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<ul>
<li>A cookie <strong>has a domain AND a path</strong>. Ex: <code>*.mit.edu/6.858/</code>
<ul>
<li>Domain can only be a (possibly full) suffix
of a page's current domain.</li>
<li>Path can be "/" to indicate that all paths in
the domain should have access to the cookie.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Whoever sets cookie gets to specify the domain
and path.
<ul>
<li>Can be set by the server using a header, or
by JavaScript code that writes to
<code>document.cookie.</code></li>
<li>There's also a <strong>"secure" flag</strong> to indicate
HTTPS-only cookies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Browser keeps cookies on client-side disk (modulo
cookie expiration, ephemeral cookies, etc.).</li>
<li>When generating an HTTP request, the browser sends
all matching cookies in the request.
<ul>
<li>Secure cookies only sent for HTTPS requests.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>JavaScript code can access any cookie that match
the code's origin, but note that the cookie's path
and the origin's port are ignored!</strong>
<ul>
<li>The protocol matters, because HTTP JavaScript
cannot access HTTPS cookies (although HTTPS
JavaScript can access both kinds of cookies).</li>
<li><em>Caveat:</em> There are also <strong>http-only cookies</strong>, that JS
code cannot access directly. Those cookies just
get sent by the browser with matching HTTP requests.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Q:</strong> Why is it important to protect cookies from
arbitrary overwriting?</li>
<li><strong>A:</strong> If an attacker controls a cookie, the attacker
can force the user to use an account that's
controlled by an attacker!
<ul>
<li>Ex: By controlling a Gmail cookie, an attacker
can redirect a user to an attacker controlled
account and read any emails that are sent from
that account.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Q:</strong> Is it valid for foo.co.uk to set a cookie's
domain to co.uk?</li>
<li><strong>A:</strong> This is valid according to the rules that we've
discussed so far, but in practice, we should disallow
such a thing, since ".co.uk" is semantically a single,
"atomic" domain like ".com". 
<ul>
<li>Mozilla maintains a 
public list which allows browsers to determine
the appropriate suffix rules for top-level domains.
See <a href="https://publicsuffix.org">PublicSuffix</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>HTTP responses: Many exceptions and half-exceptions to same-origin policy</h2>

<ul>
<li>XMLHttpRequests: By default, JavaScript can only
send XMLHttpRequests to its origin server ...
unless the remote server has enabled <strong>Cross-origin
Resource Sharing (CORS).</strong> The scheme defines some
new HTTP response headers:
<ul>
<li>Access-Control-Allow-Origin specifies which
origins can see HTTP response.</li>
<li>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials specifies
if browser should accept cookies in HTTP
request from the foreign origin.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Images:</strong> A frame can load an image from any origin
<ul>
<li>... but it can't look at the image pixels ...</li>
<li>... but it can determine the image's size.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>CSS:</strong> Similar story to images--a frame can't directly
read the content of external CSS files, but can infer
some of its properties.</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> A frame can load JavaScript from any
origin, but it can't directly examine the
source code in a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag/XMLHttpRequest
reponse body, but all JavaScript functions
have a public <code>toString()</code> method which reveals
source code and a page's home server can
always fetch the source code directly and then
pass it to the page!
<ul>
<li>To prevent reverse-engineering, many sites
minify and obfuscate their JavaScript.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Plugins: A frame can run a plugin from any origin.</li>
</ul>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;embed src=...&gt; //Requires plugin-specific  
                //elaborations.
</code></pre>

<h2>Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks</h2>

<p>Remember that, when the browser generates an HTTP
request, it automatically includes the relevant
cookies.</p>

<p>What happens if an attacker gets the user to click on a 
URL like this?
 * <code>http://bank.com/xfer?amount=500&amp;to=attacker</code></p>

<p>This attack is called a cross-site request forgery (CSRF).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Solution: Include some random data in URLs that
is difficult for the attacker to guess. Ex:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action="/transfer.cgi" ...&gt;
    &lt;input type="hidden"
           name="csrfToken"
           value="a6dbe323..."/&gt;
</code></pre></li>
<li>Each time a user requests the page, the server
generates HTML with new random tokens. When
the user submits a request, the server validates
the token before actually processing the request.</li>
<li>Drawback: If each URL to the same object is
unique, it's difficult to cache that object!</li>
</ul>

<h2>DNS rebinding attacks</h2>

<p>Network addresses almost have an origin.</p>

<ul>
<li>A frame can send HTTP <em>and</em> HTTPS requests to
a host+port that match its origin.</li>
<li>Note that the security of the same-origin policy
depends on the <strong>integrity of the DNS infrastructure!</strong></li>
<li>DNS rebinding attack
<ul>
<li><strong>Goal:</strong> Attacker wants to run attacker-controlled
JavaScript code with the authority of an origin
that he does not control (victim.com).</li>
<li>Approach:
<ol>
<li>Attacker registers a domain name (e.g.,
attacker.com) and creates a DNS server
to respond to the relevant queries.</li>
<li>User visits the attacker.com website,
e.g., by clicking on an advertisement.</li>
<li>The attacker website wants to download
a single object, but first, the browser
must issue a DNS request for attacker.com.
The attacker's DNS server responds with
a DNS record to the attacker's IP address.
However, <em>the record has a short time-to-live.</em></li>
<li>The attacker rebinds attacker.com to
the IP address of victim.com.</li>
<li>A bit later, the attacker website creates
an XMLHttpRequest that connects to
attacker.com. <strong>That request will actually
be sent to the IP address of victim.com!</strong>
The browser won't complain because it
will revalidate the DNS record and see
the new binding.</li>
<li>Okay, but the request will not have the right
cookies for victim.com because the browser
still thinks they are interacting with
attacker.com, right?</li>
<li>And won't the <code>Host:</code> header in the HTTP
request indicate attacker.com, so the victim.com
webserver can reject the request.</li>
<li>Attacker page can now exfiltrate data,
e.g., using CORS XMLHttpRequest to the
attacker domain.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Solutions:
<ul>
<li>Modify DNS resolvers so that external
hostnames can never resolve to internal
IP addreses.</li>
<li>Browsers can pin DNS bindings, regardless
of their TTL settings. However, this
may break web applications that use
dynamic DNS (e.g., for load-balancing).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>What about the pixels on a screen?</p>

<ul>
<li>They don't have an origin! A frame can draw anywhere
within its bounding box.</li>
<li>Problem: A parent frame can overlay content atop
the pixels of its child frames.
<ul>
<li>Ex: At attacker creates a page which has
an enticing button like "Click here for
a free iPad!" Atop that button, the page
creates a child frame that contains the
Facebook "Like" button. The attacker
places that button atop the "free iPad"
button, but makes it transparent! So,
if the user clicks on the "free iPad"
button, he'll actually "Like" the attackers
page on Facebook.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Solutions
<ol>
<li><strong>Frame-busting code:</strong> Include JavaScript
that prevents your page from being
included as a frame:
<ul>
<li><code>if(top != self)</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Have your web server send the <code>X-Frame-Options</code>
HTTP response header. This will instruct
the browser not to put your content in
a child frame.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<p>What about frame URLs that don't have an origin?
 * Example:
   + file://foo.txt
   + about:blank
   + javascript:document.cookie="x"
 * Sometimes the frame is only accessible to other
   frames with that protocol (e.g., file://).
   [This can be irritating if you're debugging a
   site and you want to mix file:// and http://
   content].
 * Sometimes the frame is just inaccessible to
   all other origins (e.g., "about:").
 * Sometimes the origin is inherited from whoever
   created the URL (e.g., "javascript:"). This
   prevents attacks in which a attacker.com creates
   a frame belonging to victim.com, and then navigates
   the victim frame to a javascript: URL--we don't
   want the JavaScript to execute in the context
   of victim.com!</p>

<h2>DNS names can be used as an attack vector</h2>

<ul>
<li>IDN: internationalized domain names (non-latin letters).</li>
<li>Supporting more languages is good, but now, it can
be difficult for users to distinguish two domain
names from each other.
<ul>
<li>Ex: The Cyrillic "C" character looks like the
Latin "C" character! So, an attacker can buy
a domain like "cats.com" (with a Cyrillic "C")
and trick users who thought that they were going
to "cats.com" (Latin "C").</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Good example of how new features can undermine
security assumptions.
<ul>
<li>Browser vendors thought registrars will prohibit
ambiguous names.</li>
<li>Registrars throught browser vendors will change
browser to do something.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Plugins</h2>

<p>Often have subtly-different security policies.</p>

<ul>
<li>Java: Sort of uses the same-origin policy, but Java
code can set HTTP headers (bad! see "Content-Length"
discussion), and in some cases, different hostnames
with the same IP address are considered to share
the same origin.</li>
<li>Flash: Developers place a file called <code>crossdomain.xml</code>
on their web servers. That file specifies which origins
can talk to the server via Flash.</li>
</ul>

<p>HTML5 introduces a new screen-sharing API: Once
the user gives permission, a site can capture the
entire visible screen area and transmit it back
to the site's origin.</p>

<ul>
<li>So, if an attacker page can convince the user
to grant screen-sharing permission, the attacker
page can open an iframe to a sensitive site
(e.g., banking, Facebook, email), and capture
the screen contents!</li>
<li>The iframe will send cookies, so the user will
automatically be logged in, allowing the
attacker to see "real" information, not boring
login page stuff.</li>
<li>Attacker can make the iframe flash only briefly
to prevent the user from noticing the mischief.</li>
<li>Possible defenses:
<ul>
<li>Allow users to only screen-share part
of the DOM tree? It seems like this
will be tedious and error-prone.</li>
<li>Only allow an origin to screen-capture
content from its own origin? Seems
like a more reasonable approach,
although it prevents mash-ups.</li>
</ul></li>

</ul>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>Since "The Tangled Web," there have been various
modifications and additions to the aggregate web
stack.</p>

<ul>
<li>In general, things have gotten more complicated,
which is typically bad for security.</li>
<li>For reference, here are some of the new features:
<ul>
<li>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content<em>Security</em>Policy</li>
<li>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict<em>Transport</em>Security</li>
<li>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin<em>resource</em>sharing</li>
<li>HTML5 iframe sandbox attribute [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/hh563496.aspx]</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The browser security model is obviously a mess. It's
very complex and contains a lot of subtleties and
inconsistencies.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Q:</strong> Why not rewrite the security model from scratch?</li>
<li><strong>A1:</strong> Backwards compatibility! There's a huge amount
of preexisting web infrastructure that people
rely on.</li>
<li><strong>A2:</strong> How do we know that a new security model would
be expressive enough? Users typically do not
accept a reduction of features in exchange
for an increase in security.</li>
<li><strong>A3:</strong> Any security model may be intrinsically
doomed---perhaps all popular systems are
destined to accumulate a ton of features
as time progresses. [Ex: Word processing
programs, smartphones.]</li>
<li>What might a better design look like?
<ul>
<li>Strict isolation Embassies---everything 
is a network message, even locally
[https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi13/nsdi13-final85.pdf]</li>
<li>Don't make policy extraction and enforcement
dependent on complex parsing rules (remember
our sanitization example)</li>
<li>Only add features in small, clearly-defined
quanta with minimal room for implementation
error or interpretation mistakes---remove
ambiguity and the need for guessing.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
